# How to Run The Code.

Steps to run the code for question 1 namely the Question_1_Mid_Sem_Coding_Assign.ipynb file:
1. Run all the cells in the order they are given.
2. For the input we first give in the dimensions of the matrix with '1' signifiying un-blocked cell and '0' signifying a blocked cell.
3. Then we take input for the matrix wherein we input each element in a row major order.
4. Then we need to input starting point and ending point by giving their x and y components.
5. Then for all direction we need to input 1 for 'True' and 0 for 'False'.

Steps to run the code for question 1 namely the Question_2_Mid_Sem_Coding_Assign.ipynb file:
